# Description :point_left:
A React based novel Reader and writer website
This website will act as a platform for the writers to showcase their creativity and the
language will not be limited to just English. Currently people who cannot enjoy their
local novels due to inaccessibility or unavailability. The users will be able to get content
from their favorite authors.
The TTS (Text to Speech) feature can also be used by the readers who have visual
imparity. This also helps in providing the users with the hands-free feature so they
can enjoy while doing their other work simultaneously.
# Aim :point_left:
The aim of our project is to create an inclusive Novel reading and writing
software in which readers can read through a wide variety of novels of different
genres and is available in different languages and also, writers can exhibit their
writing skills and upload their own work for others to read and get recognized
through our website. The website can be applicable to people of all age groups
as they can access and read books of their choice. This website also acts as a
platform for new and rising authors to write and share their books for the public
to view and gain popularity. This will act as a source of motivation for them to
keep writing and improving.
