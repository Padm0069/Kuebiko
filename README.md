A React based novel Reader and writer website
This website will act as a platform for the writers to showcase their creativity and the
language will not be limited to just English. Currently people who cannot enjoy their
local novels due to inaccessibility or unavailability. The users will be able to get content
from their favorite authors.
The TTS (Text to Speech) feature can also be used by the readers who have visual
imparity. This also helps in providing the users with the hands-free feature so they
canenjoy while doing their other work simultaneously.
